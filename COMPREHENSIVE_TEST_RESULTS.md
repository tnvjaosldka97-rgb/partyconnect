- **Test**: Examined party cards on homepage
- **Result**: Images display correctly in 4:3 aspect ratio
- **Technical Details**:

  - Images fill container properly
  - No unexpected cropping observed
  - Hover effects work correctly

**Image Container CSS:**
```tsx
<div className="relative aspect-[4/3] overflow-hidden">
  <img
    src={image}
    alt={title}
    className="w-full h-full object-cover group-hover:scale-110 transition-transform duration-500"
  />
</div>
```

### 5. Data Synchronization ⚠️ PARTIAL ISSUE

#### Homepage Display vs Admin Dashboard
- **Issue**: Modified party (with "TEST" prefix) did not appear on homepage
- **Reason**: Homepage only displays parties with `status === "approved"`
- **Modified Party Status**: "rejected"
- **Conclusion**: This is **expected behavior**, not a bug

**Code Reference (storage.ts):**
```typescript
export function getApprovedParties(): Party[] {
  const parties = getParties();
  return parties.filter((party) => party.status === "approved");
}
```
