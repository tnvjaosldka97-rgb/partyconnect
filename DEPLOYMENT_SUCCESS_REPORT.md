## 🔧 Technical Solutions Applied

### Problem 1: Build Command Path Issue
**Error**: `sh: line 1: cd: client: No such file or directory`

**Root Cause**: Conflicting Root Directory and Build Command settings in Vercel

**Solution**: Created `vercel.json` with explicit configuration:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd client && pnpm install && pnpm build",
  "outputDirectory": "client/dist",
  "installCommand": "echo 'Skipping root install'",
  "framework": "vite"
}
```

### Problem 2: SPA Routing (404 Errors)
**Error**: 404 NOT_FOUND when accessing `/all-parties`, `/admin/login`, etc.

**Root Cause**: Vercel treating client-side routes as server-side routes

**Solution**: Added rewrites configuration to `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

This ensures all routes are handled by the React Router in the SPA.
