## üîç Known Limitations

### Current System

1. **LocalStorage-based**: Data not persistent across browsers/devices
2. **No Backend**: No server-side validation or real authentication
3. **Hardcoded Admin**: Credentials in code (not secure for production)
4. **No File Storage**: Uploaded images stored as blob URLs (temporary)

### Recommendations for Production

1. **Backend Integration**:
   - Implement REST API or GraphQL
   - Use PostgreSQL or MongoDB for data persistence
   - Implement JWT authentication
   - Add email notification system

2. **File Storage**:
   - Integrate AWS S3 or Cloudinary
   - Implement proper image optimization
   - Add virus scanning for uploads

3. **Security**:
   - Implement proper admin authentication
   - Add RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
   - Add CSRF protection
   - Implement rate limiting
