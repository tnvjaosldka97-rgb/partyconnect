# Vercel Deployment Fix - Output Directory Issue

## 🚨 Current Issue

**Error**: "No Output Directory named 'dist' found after the Build completed"

**Root Cause**: The project has the frontend code in the `client` subdirectory, but Vercel is looking for the build output in the root directory.

## ✅ Solution (Choose One)

### Option 1: Configure Root Directory in Vercel Settings (Recommended)

This is the **simplest and fastest** solution.

**Steps**:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your **"partyconnect"** project
3. Navigate to **Settings** → **General**
4. Scroll down to **Build & Development Settings**
5. Find **Root Directory** setting
6. Click **Edit** and set it to: `client`
7. Click **Save**
8. Go to **Deployments** tab
9. Click the three dots (...) on the latest deployment
10. Click **Redeploy**

**Why this works**: By setting the root directory to `client`, Vercel will treat the `client` folder as the project root. The build command `pnpm build` will run in the `client` directory and output to `dist`, which Vercel will find.

### Option 2: Update vercel.json (Alternative)

If you prefer to keep the configuration in code:

**File**: `/vercel.json`

Update the existing `vercel.json` file with:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd client && pnpm install && pnpm build",
  "outputDirectory": "client/dist",
  "installCommand": "pnpm install",
  "framework": "vite",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Steps**:
1. Update `vercel.json` with the above configuration
2. Commit and push changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add vercel.json
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel output directory configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. Vercel will automatically redeploy

## 📋 Correct Vercel Settings

After applying the fix, your settings should be:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Framework Preset | Vite |
| Root Directory | `client` ⬅️ **This is the key!** |
| Build Command | `pnpm build` |
| Output Directory | `dist` |
| Install Command | `pnpm install` |

## 🧪 Test Before Deploying

Test the build locally to ensure it works:

```bash
# Navigate to client directory
cd client

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Check that dist folder was created
ls -la dist

# Preview production build (optional)
pnpm preview
```

If the `dist` folder is created successfully, the Vercel deployment should work.

## 🔍 Verification Steps

After redeploying:

1. ✅ Check deployment status in Vercel dashboard
2. ✅ Wait for "Ready" status (usually 2-3 minutes)
3. ✅ Visit your deployment URL
4. ✅ Test the following:
   - Homepage loads
   - Navigation works
   - All Parties page displays parties
   - Filter toggle works
   - Google Translate widget appears
   - Become a Host form loads
   - Admin login works

## 🐛 If Still Not Working

### Check Build Logs

1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click on the failed deployment
3. Click **"View Build Logs"**
4. Look for specific error messages

### Common Issues

**Issue**: TypeScript errors in `server/index.ts`

**Solution**: These are backend errors and don't affect frontend deployment. They can be ignored. To suppress them:

```bash
# Option 1: Remove server directory (if not needed)
rm -rf server

# Option 2: Update .gitignore to exclude server
echo "server/" >> .gitignore
```

**Issue**: "Command not found: pnpm"

**Solution**: Vercel should auto-detect pnpm. If not, add this to `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "installCommand": "npm install -g pnpm && pnpm install"
}
```

**Issue**: Routes not working (404 on refresh)

**Solution**: Ensure `vercel.json` has the rewrite rule:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 📊 Project Structure

For reference, here's the correct project structure:

```
partyconnect/
├── client/              # ⬅️ Set this as Root Directory in Vercel
│   ├── src/
│   ├── public/
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── vite.config.ts
│   └── dist/           # ⬅️ Build output (created after build)
├── server/             # (Not deployed to Vercel)
├── package.json        # Root package.json
└── vercel.json         # Vercel configuration
```

## 🎯 Quick Fix Summary

**Fastest Solution**:
1. Go to Vercel Settings → General → Build & Development Settings
2. Set **Root Directory** to `client`
3. Save and redeploy

**That's it!** 🎉
