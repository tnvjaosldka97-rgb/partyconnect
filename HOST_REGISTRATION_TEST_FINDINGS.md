### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found

#### 1. Form Submission Validation
**Issue**: When clicking "Apply to Become a Host" button without completing required fields, no visible validation errors appear.

**Expected Behavior**:
- Error messages should appear for missing required fields
- Form should scroll to first error
- Submit button should be disabled until all required fields are filled

**Actual Behavior**:
- Button click has no visible effect
- No error messages displayed
- Page remains in same position

**Severity**: Medium - Users may not understand why form isn't submitting

**Recommendation**: Add client-side validation with clear error messages

---

#### 2. Required File Uploads
**Issue**: Cannot test file upload functionality without actual files

**Test Limitation**: 
- ID Card Copy (required)
- Criminal Record Document (required)
- Cannot proceed with form submission without these files

**Recommendation**: For testing purposes, consider adding a "Test Mode" that bypasses file requirements

---

### üìã Form Validation Logic

Based on the form structure, the following validations should be in place:

**Required Fields:**
1. Full Name
2. Phone Number
3. Email
4. City
5. Space Type
6. Address
7. Capacity (minimum 5)
8. About You
9. ID Card Copy (file)
10. Criminal Record Document (file)
11. Terms of Service checkbox
12. Consent to Prohibition checkbox

**Optional Fields:**
1. Hosting Experience
2. Space Photos (file)

## Code Review Findings

### BecomeHost.tsx Component

**Form Submission Handler**: Need to check if validation is implemented

**File Upload Handlers**: Need to verify file upload logic

**Form State Management**: Need to verify state updates

---

## Next Steps

To complete the host registration test, we need to:

1. **Check BecomeHost.tsx code** to understand validation logic
2. **Test with actual files** or mock file uploads
3. **Verify form submission** to localStorage or backend
4. **Test Admin Dashboard** to see if applications appear
5. **Test approval/rejection flow** in Admin Dashboard
