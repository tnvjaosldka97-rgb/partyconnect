# Host Rejection System - Comprehensive Improvements

## Overview
Complete overhaul of the host rejection workflow with custom rejection reasons, data persistence, admin management tools, and enhanced user experience.

---

## 1. Custom Rejection Reasons (Admin)

### Features
- **Rejection Dialog**: Admin can provide detailed, custom rejection reasons
- **Required Field**: Rejection reason is mandatory before confirming rejection
- **Example Guidance**: Placeholder text provides examples of good rejection reasons
- **Character Limit**: Textarea allows detailed explanations

### Implementation
- **File**: `client/src/pages/HostApprovals.tsx`
- **Dialog UI**: Modal overlay with textarea for rejection reason input
- **Validation**: Prevents submission without a reason
- **Storage**: Rejection reason saved to `HostApplication.rejectionReason`

### User Flow
1. Admin clicks "Reject Application" button
2. Modal dialog appears with textarea
3. Admin enters detailed rejection reason
4. Clicks "Confirm Rejection"
5. Application status updated to "rejected" with reason

---

## 2. Auto-Load Previous Application Data

### Features
- **Automatic Detection**: Detects if user has previous rejected application
- **Pre-fill Form**: All form fields automatically populated with previous data
- **Image Persistence**: ID card and criminal record images pre-loaded
- **User Notification**: Toast message informs user that data was loaded
- **Editable**: User can modify any field before resubmitting

### Implementation
- **File**: `client/src/pages/BecomeHost.tsx`
- **useEffect Hook**: Runs on component mount to check for previous application
- **localStorage Check**: Uses `hostEmail` to find previous application
- **Conditional Loading**: Only loads if status is "rejected"

### User Flow
1. Rejected user visits `/become-host`
2. System checks localStorage for `hostEmail`
3. Finds previous application with "rejected" status
4. Pre-fills all form fields with previous data
5. Toast notification appears
6. User can edit and resubmit

### Pre-filled Fields
- ✅ Full Name
- ✅ Email
- ✅ Phone
- ✅ City
- ✅ Address
- ✅ Space Type
- ✅ Capacity
- ✅ Bio/Introduction
- ✅ Experience
- ✅ ID Card Image
- ✅ Criminal Record Image
- ❌ Checkboxes (Reset for security/legal reasons)

## 3. Rejected Hosts Tab (Admin)

### Features
- **Tab Switcher**: Toggle between "Pending" and "Rejected" applications
- **Separate Views**: Clean separation of pending vs rejected applications
- **Rejection Details**: Shows rejection reason and rejection date
- **Read-Only View**: No action buttons for rejected applications
- **Badge Indicators**: Visual distinction with red "Rejected" badge

### Implementation
- **File**: `client/src/pages/HostApprovals.tsx`
- **State Management**: `viewMode` state controls current view
- **Conditional Rendering**: Different UI for pending vs rejected
- **Tab UI**: Glass-morphism styled tab switcher

### Admin View Components

#### Pending Applications Tab
- Verification checklist (ID, Sex Offender Registry)
- NSOPW link for background check
- "Approve Host" button (requires checks)
- "Reject Application" button
- Yellow "Pending Review" badge

#### Rejected Applications Tab
- Rejection reason display (red box)
- Rejection date
- No action buttons
- Red "Rejected" badge
- Host contact information

### User Flow
1. Admin navigates to Host Approvals
2. Default view: "Pending Applications"
3. Click "Rejected Applications" tab
4. View list of all rejected applications
5. See rejection reasons for each
6. Switch back to "Pending" tab as needed

---

## 4. UX Improvements

### A. Rejection Reason Display (User-Facing)

**Location**: `/host/rejected` page

**Features**:
- Prominent display of admin's custom rejection reason
- Red-bordered card for visual emphasis
- Fallback to generic reasons if no custom reason provided
- Clear, empathetic messaging

**Implementation**:
```tsx
{hostInfo?.rejectionReason && (
  <div className="border border-red-500/20">
    <h2>Rejection Reason</h2>
    <p>{hostInfo.rejectionReason}</p>
  </div>
)}
```

### B. Enhanced Dialog UI

**Rejection Dialog** (Admin):
- Glass-morphism background blur
- Clear modal with close button
- Textarea with placeholder examples
- Cancel and Confirm buttons
- Proper z-index layering

### C. Improved Form Experience

**BecomeHost Page**:
- Loading state while checking for previous data
- Toast notification when data is loaded
- Visual indication of pre-filled fields
- Smooth form population

### D. Better Status Indicators

**Badge System**:
- **Pending**: Yellow badge with "Pending Review"
- **Rejected**: Red badge with "Rejected"
- **Approved**: Green badge (existing)

### E. Date Formatting

**Consistent Date Display**:
- Applied date: Always shown
- Rejected date: Shown only for rejected applications
- Format: `en-US` locale with time
- Example: "10/29/2025, 2:30:45 PM"

### F. Responsive Design

**Mobile Optimization**:
- Tab switcher works on mobile
- Rejection dialog responsive
- Form pre-fill works on all devices
- Touch-friendly buttons

### G. Error Handling

**Validation**:
- Rejection reason required
- Clear error messages
- Toast notifications for all actions
- Console logging for debugging

### H. Data Persistence

**localStorage Management**:
- `hostEmail` stored after application
- Used to retrieve previous applications
- Cleared on logout
- Secure and private

---

## Data Schema Updates

### HostApplication Interface

```typescript
export interface HostApplication {
  // ... existing fields
  rejectionReason?: string;  // NEW: Admin's custom rejection reason
  rejectedAt?: string;       // NEW: Timestamp of rejection
}
```

### Zod Schema

```typescript
const HostApplicationSchema = z.object({
  // ... existing fields
  rejectionReason: z.string().optional(),
  rejectedAt: z.string().optional(),
});
```

---

## API/Function Updates

### `updateHostApplicationStatus`

**Signature**:
```typescript
function updateHostApplicationStatus(
  id: string,
  status: "approved" | "rejected",
  rejectionReason?: string  // NEW parameter
): boolean
```

**Behavior**:
- If status is "approved": Sets `approvedAt` timestamp
- If status is "rejected": Sets `rejectedAt` and `rejectionReason`
- Validates and saves to localStorage

### `getHostByEmail`

**Usage**: Retrieve previous application by email
- Used in BecomeHost to pre-fill form
- Used in HostRejected to show rejection details
- Filters by email (case-insensitive)
