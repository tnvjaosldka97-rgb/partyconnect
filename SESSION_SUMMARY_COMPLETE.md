## ‚úÖ All Completed Tasks (5 Commits)

### 1. Image Compression Implementation ‚≠ê CRITICAL
**Commit:** `2f22738`  
**Problem:** Host applications failed with "QuotaExceededError" when uploading multiple high-resolution images.

**Solution:**
- Created `/client/src/lib/imageCompression.ts`
- Compresses images to max 1200x1200px at 80% JPEG quality
- Reduces file size by ~90% (2-3 MB ‚Üí 200-400 KB)
- Applied to all image uploads in BecomeHost.tsx

**Impact:** ‚úÖ Host applications now work with multiple images

---

### 2. Admin Page Error Fix
**Commit:** `1e596aa`  
**Problem:** `ReferenceError: Home is not defined` on admin host approvals page.

**Solution:**
- Added missing `Home` icon import in HostApprovals.tsx

**Impact:** ‚úÖ Admin can now view host applications without errors

---

### 3. Time Input Locale Fix
**Commit:** `e6e154a`  
**Problem:** Time input displayed Korean (Ïò§ÌõÑ/Ïò§Ï†Ñ) instead of English (AM/PM).

**Solution:**
- Added `lang="en-US"` attribute to time input in CreateParty.tsx

**Impact:** ‚úÖ Consistent English interface

---

### 4. User Profile Enhancement ‚≠ê NEW FEATURE
**Commit:** `475cb01`  
**Feature:** Display hosted parties on user profile page.

**Implementation:**
- Added `getPartiesByHostEmail()` function to storage.ts
- Created "My Hosted Parties" section in UserProfile.tsx
- Shows party cards with status, date, location, attendees, price
- Each card links to party detail page

**Impact:** ‚úÖ Hosts can view and manage their parties from profile

---

### 5. User Profile Host Detection Fix
**Commit:** `82f7c53`  
**Problem:** Approved hosts showed as "Client" with "Not logged in" email.

**Root Cause:**
- BecomeHost saves email as `"hostEmail"`
- UserProfile only checked `"userEmail"`
- Key mismatch caused profile to not detect host status

**Solution:**
- UserProfile now checks both `"userEmail"` and `"hostEmail"` keys
- Fixed fullName display to use `name` or `firstName + lastName`

**Impact:** ‚úÖ Approved hosts now correctly show as "Host" with full profile info
