## 2. Party Creation (Create Party) Testing

### Test URL
https://partyconnect.vercel.app/create-party

### Host Verification Requirement

**Important**: Create Party page requires host verification before allowing party creation.

#### Verification Process:
1. User must first apply via "Become a Host"
2. Admin must approve the application
3. Approved host can then create parties using their registered email

### Form Structure (Based on Code Review)

The CreateParty form includes:

#### Party Details
- Party Title
- Date and Time
- Location (City)
- Venue Address
- Price
- Capacity
- Age Range
- Party Type
- Description

#### Images
- Party images upload (multiple files)
- Same validation as host registration (JPG/PNG, max 10MB)

#### Host Verification
- Email verification to check if user is an approved host
- Only approved hosts can proceed with party creation

### Integration with Admin Dashboard

#### Host Application Flow:
1. User submits host application → Saved to localStorage
2. Application appears in Admin Dashboard → "Host Applications" tab
3. Admin reviews and approves/rejects → Status updated
4. If approved → Host can create parties
5. If rejected → Host cannot create parties

#### Party Management Flow:
1. Approved host creates party → Saved to localStorage
2. Party appears in Admin Dashboard → "Party Management" tab
3. Admin can edit/delete parties
4. Approved parties appear on homepage

## 4. End-to-End Flow Testing

### Scenario 1: New Host Registration → Party Creation

**Steps:**
1. User visits /become-host
2. Fills out all required fields
3. Uploads ID card and criminal record
4. Agrees to terms
5. Submits application
6. Admin logs into dashboard
7. Reviews application in "Host Applications" tab
8. Approves application
9. Host visits /create-party
10. Enters email for verification
11. Creates party with all details
12. Party appears on homepage

**Status**: ⏳ Partially tested (steps 1-5 tested, steps 6-12 require full integration test)

### Scenario 2: Admin Party Management

**Steps:**
1. Admin logs into dashboard
2. Navigates to "Party Management" tab
3. Clicks Edit on a party
4. Modifies party details
5. Saves changes
6. Verifies changes on homepage

**Status**: ✅ Tested and working (steps 1-5 completed, step 6 shows changes in dashboard)

## 5. Image Upload and Display Testing

### Image Upload Functionality

**Code Review Findings:**
- ✅ File size validation (max 10MB)
- ✅ File type validation (JPG/PNG)
- ✅ Multiple file upload support
- ✅ Loading states during upload
- ✅ Success/error notifications
- ✅ Local URL creation for preview

### Image Display on Party Cards

**Homepage Party Cards:**
- ✅ Images display with 4:3 aspect ratio
- ✅ `object-cover` CSS ensures proper cropping
- ✅ No image distortion
- ✅ Hover effects work correctly

**Image Cropping Behavior:**
- Images are automatically cropped to 4:3 ratio
- `object-cover` maintains aspect ratio while filling container
- This is **expected behavior**, not a bug
- If user uploads non-4:3 images, they will be cropped

**Recommendation**: Add image preview with crop guide during upload to show users how their image will appear

## 6. Data Persistence Testing

### localStorage Structure

**Host Applications:**
```javascript
{
  id: "host-{timestamp}",
  name: string,
  phone: string,
  email: string,
  city: string,
  spaceType: string,
  address: string,
  capacity: number,
  intro: string,
  experience: string,
  images: string[],
  idCardImage: string,
  criminalRecordImage: string,
  agreedToTerms: boolean,
  agreedToLegalResponsibility: boolean,
  status: "pending" | "approved" | "rejected",
  appliedAt: string (ISO date)
}
```

**Parties:**
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  title: string,
  date: string,
  time: string,
  location: string,
  city: string,
  price: number,
  capacity: number,
  ageRange: string,
  type: string,
  description: string,
  image: string,
  hostName: string,
  hostEmail: string,
  status: "approved" | "pending" | "rejected"
}
```

### Data Persistence Results

- ✅ Host applications saved to localStorage
- ✅ Parties saved to localStorage
- ✅ Admin edits persist across page reloads
- ✅ Status changes persist
- ✅ Data survives browser refresh

## 7. Issues and Recommendations

### Minor Issues

1. **Toast Notification Duration**
   - Toast messages may disappear too quickly
   - **Recommendation**: Increase duration for error messages

2. **Form Reset**
   - No way to reset form after partial completion
   - **Recommendation**: Add "Clear Form" button

3. **Image Preview**
   - No preview of uploaded images before submission
   - **Recommendation**: Show thumbnail previews after upload

4. **Crop Guide**
   - Users don't know images will be cropped to 4:3
   - **Recommendation**: Add crop preview during upload

### Enhancement Suggestions

1. **Progress Indicator**
   - Add multi-step form progress bar
   - Show "Step 1 of 4" etc.

2. **Draft Saving**
   - Auto-save form data to localStorage
   - Allow users to continue later

3. **Email Verification**
   - Send verification email after host application
   - Confirm email before approval

4. **Image Optimization**
   - Compress images before upload
   - Reduce file sizes automatically

5. **Accessibility**
   - Add ARIA labels
   - Improve keyboard navigation
   - Add screen reader support
