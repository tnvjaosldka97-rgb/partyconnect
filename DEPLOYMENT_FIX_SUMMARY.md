# Vercel Deployment Fix Summary

## Current Issue

The deployment is failing with error: `sh: line 1: cd: client: No such file or directory`

## Root Cause

The Vercel settings have a conflict:
- **Root Directory**: Set to `client` ✅
- **Build Command**: Still contains `cd client &&` ❌
- **Output Directory**: Still set to `client/dist` ❌

When Root Directory is set to `client`, Vercel already starts the build process inside the `client` directory. The `cd client` command then fails because there's no nested `client` directory.

## Solution

You need to update the Vercel settings manually through the web UI:

### Step 1: Go to Settings
Navigate to: https://vercel.com/onlyup/partyconnect/settings/build-and-deployment

### Step 2: Update Build Command
1. Find the "Build Command" field
2. Click the "Override" toggle to enable editing
3. Clear the current value: `cd client && pnpm install && pnpm build`
4. Enter new value: `pnpm install && pnpm build`
5. Click "Save"

### Step 3: Update Output Directory
1. Find the "Output Directory" field  
2. Click the "Override" toggle to enable editing
3. Clear the current value: `client/dist`
4. Enter new value: `dist`
5. Click "Save"

### Step 4: Keep Root Directory
- **Root Directory**: Keep as `client` (already set correctly)

### Step 5: Redeploy
1. Go to Deployments page
2. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
3. **IMPORTANT**: Uncheck "Use existing Build Cache"
4. Click "Redeploy"

## Expected Result

After these changes, the build should succeed because:
- Vercel will start in the `client` directory (Root Directory setting)
- Run `pnpm install && pnpm build` (no cd command needed)
- Find the output in `dist` directory (relative to `client`)

## Alternative: Use Vercel CLI

If the web UI is not working, you can use Vercel CLI:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/partyconnect
vercel --prod
```

This will deploy directly from the command line and bypass the GitHub integration temporarily.
