## 🔍 How It Works

### Host Registration Flow
1. User fills out "Become a Host" form
2. Email is saved in `hostApplications` (LocalStorage)
3. Admin reviews application in Admin Dashboard
4. Admin approves → Host status = "approved"
5. Host can now create parties

### Party Creation Flow
1. Host enters email on "Create Party" page
2. System checks if email is approved
3. If approved → Host can fill out party form
4. Party is saved to LocalStorage
5. Success message + redirect to All Parties

---

## ⚠️ Current Limitations (Prototype)

### Data Storage
- **LocalStorage only** (client-side)
- Data is lost when browser cache is cleared
- No server-side persistence

### Party Display
- New parties saved to LocalStorage
- `AllParties` page shows `mockParties` (static data)
- **Workaround**: Check Admin Dashboard to see created parties

### Why This Happens
- Two different Party type definitions:
  - `types/party.ts` → Used by mockParties (has `image`, `dateTimestamp`, `priceFormatted`)
  - `lib/storage.ts` → Used by CreateParty (has `images[]`, `time`, `hostId`)
- Type mismatch prevents easy merging

---

## 🚀 Production Requirements

To make this fully functional in production:

### 1. Backend API
```
POST /api/hosts/apply
GET  /api/hosts/:email
PUT  /api/hosts/:id/approve

POST /api/parties
GET  /api/parties
GET  /api/parties/:id
```

### 2. Database
- **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB**
- Tables: `hosts`, `parties`, `users`, `bookings`

### 3. File Storage
- **AWS S3** or **Cloudinary**
- Store: host ID cards, criminal records, party images

### 4. Authentication
- **JWT** tokens
- Email verification
- Password hashing (bcrypt)

### 5. Type Unification
- Merge Party types into one
- Use same interface across frontend/backend
