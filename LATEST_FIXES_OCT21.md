## üîß Issues Fixed Today

### 1. ‚úÖ Admin-Created Parties Not Showing on Site

**Problem**: Parties created through Admin were not appearing on homepage or All Parties page.

**Solution**: 
- Modified CreateParty.tsx to auto-approve parties when admin is logged in
- Admin-created parties now get `status: "approved"` automatically
- Regular host parties still require manual approval

**Files Modified**: `/client/src/pages/CreateParty.tsx`

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Filter Toggle Not Working on Homepage

**Problem**: Filter buttons on homepage didn't toggle on/off.

**Solution**: 
- Added toggle logic to FeaturedParties component
- Filters now activate/deactivate on click
- Matches AllParties page behavior

**Files Modified**: `/client/src/components/FeaturedParties.tsx`

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Homepage Not Loading Approved Parties

**Problem**: Homepage only showed mock data, not real approved parties.

**Solution**:
- Added localStorage loading in FeaturedParties
- Combined mock parties with approved parties
- Both types now display together

**Files Modified**: `/client/src/components/FeaturedParties.tsx`

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Google Translate Widget Too Large

**Problem**: Language selector appeared too large in header.

**Solution**:
- Applied scale(0.85) transform
- Widget now appears smaller and more compact

**Files Modified**: `/client/src/components/GoogleTranslate.tsx`

---

### 5. ‚úÖ English Not in Language Selector

**Problem**: English was missing from Google Translate dropdown.

**Solution**:
- Changed pageLanguage from "en" to "ko"
- English now appears in language list

**Files Modified**: `/client/src/components/GoogleTranslate.tsx`
